    <li>Like the home page mentions, it's difficult to think without having some sort of back and forth. You can approximate the back and forth by using Sims.</li>
    <li>A Sim is a simulation of someone you're pretending to be. In the example below, I pretend to be my future self and say, "You're such an idiot" to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow'>System I</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    Usage: when a statement is clicked on/active, press <code>cmd + ctrl + j</code> to toggle the Sim that it belongs to. Alternatively, click the Sim to toggle it (the ovals that the arrows point to in the image above).

    <li>To anyone who's read <a href='http://hpmor.com/'>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>, think of Harry's inner Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as Sims. Other examples include his simulations of people he respects like Hermoine and Quirrell.</li>
    <li>I think it's useful to use Sims that oppose one another so you don't get too one-sided.</li>
    <li>One subtle benefit I see to using Sims is that it permits you to pursue lines of thought that you otherwise wouldn't pursue. In the example below, without Sims, I normally wouldn't pursue the "Ugh, I'm better than that" line of thought because I label it as wrong and stupid. But if it's System I that's making the point and not "me", I feel better about pursuing it.</li>
