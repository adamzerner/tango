  <ul>
    <li>Tangos can either be public or private.</li>
    <li>By default, they're private.</li>
    <li>To share a Tango with someone, toggle the state to public (unchecked), navigate to your tango by clicking the link, and give them the url.</li>
    <li>The url should look like this: <code>tangoapp.herokuapp.com/tango/TANGO_ID_HERE</code></li>
    <li>They'll be able to see your Tango, but they won't be able to edit or delete it.</li>
    <li>After sharing a Tango with someone, you could revoke access by making it private again. After you make it private, even if someone has the url, they won't be able to access the Tango.</li>
  </ul>
